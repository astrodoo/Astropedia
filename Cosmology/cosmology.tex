\section{Hubble law}
The relative velocity $v$ between two galaxies that are separated by a large distance r is given by the 
Hubble law:
\begin{equation}
   v = H_{0}\,r,
\end{equation}
where $H_{0}$ is the {\bf Hubble constant}:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:hubbleconst}
    H_{0} = (72 \pm 8)\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}.
\end{equation}
